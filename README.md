# TD-Project9 Summary:

  In the project, we are challenged to create a Gallery App with React

  Step 1: Use React-Create-app to create an the build environment for the app

          I used the command: `npx create-react-app project9-gallery-app`.

          So the main app is in the directory, project9-gallery-app
