# TD-Project9 Summary:

  As part of Team Treehouse Full-Stack Java Script Tech Degree...

  In this project, we are challenged to create a Gallery App with React.

    Preparing for the project:

      Created this GitHib repo

          added a section line at the top of .gitignore

          # TD-Project9 specific directories and files
          project9-gallery-app/node_modules/

      Got a Flickr Api Key

          Logged in to Flicker, using my Yahoo acct,

          went to the Flickr's App Garden and got a non-commercial api key..

          placed the key in config.js that exports an object, flickr.apikey

          place reference to config.js in the repo's .gitignore  
          under
          # TD-Project9 specific directories and files
          project9-gallery-app/data/config.js

    Step 1: Use React-Create-app to create an the build environment for the app

          Using the command: `npx create-react-app project9-gallery-app`.

          I created the build environment for the app...
            which is in the directory, project9-gallery-app/
