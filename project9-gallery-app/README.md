# To Build and Run your own version of the TD-Project9 React Gallery App:

# For Developers:

    Please make sure to update all project deps

        caveat: code in this repo may not work after you do update project deps

    This readme.md provides the basic how-to ..

    .. for developers who might download and/or clone this repo.

    .. and want to modify it, build and run their own version

# Assuming you know to download and/or clone a github repo...

# Using Create App built-in scripts:

    npm start
      Starts the development server.

    npm run build
      Bundles the app into static files for production.

    npm test
      Starts the test runner.

    npm run eject
      Removes this tool
      copies ...
        build dependencies,
        configuration files
        and scripts into the app directory.
      If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

# Flicker API keys setup:

    To get this project up and running you will need...

    a Flickr non-commercial api key.

    I did not include mine in this repo for obvious reasons..

# Steps to get a Flicker non-commercial api key:

      STEP 1:

      have a yahoo acct, use it to sign in to Flickr

      and go to the App Garden and apply for a non-commercial api key..

[Follow this link to apply for a non-commercial api-key from Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/services/apps/create/apply/)

      STEP 2:

      Place your API-KEY and associated SECRET in a safe, secure place

        in your code, place it in a separate file that is....

        NOT part of your github repo

        The way the api-key is imported into the react app works ....

          BUT IS DEFINITELY NOT FOR PRODUCTION USE - see step 4

      STEP 3:

      Decide whether you will need to use your FLICKR SECRET

        For this project you will just need your FLICKR API-KEY

          The 'SECRET' is needed only when...

            the flickr api method requires a sign-on.

          For flickr app sign-on, Flickr requires using OATH.

            Since I dont use flickr's methods that require a sign-on...

            this project does NOT implement OATH on the backend or frontend

[To read about, learn how your Flickr app should use OATH follow this link](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/auth.oauth.html)

      STEP 4:

        As stated above,

        this repo does not use any front-end authentication

        and is an experimental app only, not meant for production

            Some suggest placing your api keys ...

            in a hidden gitignored .env file at the root of your project

            Then in your app, import and assign it to a variable like :

                const myapikey = process.env.myflickerapikey

                   However, in my testing as well as other's,

                   the api key still is visible

                   So this is a no-go for production projects

            So from React documentation

                https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-custom-environment-variables/

                WARNING:

                Do not store any secrets (such as private API keys) in your React app!

                Environment variables are embedded into the build,

                   ... meaning anyone can view them by...

                   inspecting your app's react code in chrome's react inspector

         So, the solution to this is very advanced

         and it is more of an infrastructure implementation issue

            for example, many recommended that a Backend server should be setup

                then the backend server handles app external api calls securely

                  this is not difficult,

                    for example, AXIOS does this

                however, a react app is still ...

                  front-end code running in a user's browser

                  and will need to call the backend server routes

                    so among other things....

                        secure auth and tsl encrypted communication must be setup

                        This is all out of the scope of this project

         For stuff like OATH, please check OAuth2

            or other Security Authentication sources

      Step 5:

      Verify the flickr api call and methods that your app will need...

          Using the link to flickr's api method helper...

          ...link is immediately below this paragraph...

          The flickr api method helper will show the ....

            available methods, options and response data

            as well as a complete working flickr api url request

          but it will also...

          plug a 'temp' API-KEY for you, to demo the api-call functionality

          don't fooled...

          ....by the demo of flickr non-sign-on methods...

          you will still need your API-KEY in your app's api calls ....

          otherwise none of the flickr method's api calls will work

          in latest verisons of Chrome an warning is logged

            xhr.js:178 HTTP-Based Public Key Pinning is deprecated.
            Chrome 69 and later will ignore HPKP response headers.
            (Host: api.flickr.com)

            this highlights the warning on this from Step 4...

              implement, review, triple check security ...

              before going production with any app or service


[To verify your flickr method api call syntax, follow this link](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/explore/flickr.photos.search)

      Step 6:

          using flickr.photo.search

          with a query of sunset

          I saved a sample set of data to a json file


[A how to piece photo source urls together, including image size, safe-search, # per page..](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/misc.urls.html)

    Warning:  I hoped to make this a 'family-friendly' photo searching app

    it seems....
      Flickr relies on photo owners and creators to...
       tag their photos correctly
       so the safe-search options ... frequently do not filter out 'mature' or 'adult' content

      I started writing a custom filter using regexp and string matching

        to start catching words and phrases that someone may innocently use

        but no matter how exhaustive, seems to consistently return 'unexpected' results

[Sample Photo src url, saved to json format](./src/Flickr/howTo.json)

[A sample set of data set can be found here ](./src/Flickr/sample.json)

     Step 7:

        Untill I can find a solution to to following issues,

            I will not be moving forward with this project

        If you get past the 'Flicker API keys setup' ...

        Implement Auth and some sort of backend server

            to securely handle api calls, (this is not too hard, can use axious for example)

            without leaving backend sever routes exposed to the internet...

        and feel comfortable with how flicker and other photo/image sources ...

            do/do not tag mature content properly

            or have found another source of images and photos to search

        then you are probably ready for a little break ...

        and the next phase..

        Godspeed...
